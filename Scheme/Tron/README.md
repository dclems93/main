# What is Tron?

TRON is a clone game based on the famous game and movie from the 1980's.
It was made in RACKET and utilizes a lot of functions that were inherited from 
the 2htdp libraries that added functionality for animation and an on-tick, which
allowed for creation of a game.

TRON is a programming demonstration on using recursion and functional programming
for the purposes of a video game, rather than just using a traditional Object Oriented
programming language.

# How do I use Tron?

and a terminal at the bottom. If you run (main INITIAL) in the terminal, the game will
initialize.
