# CS343 : Line Intersection

This project implements algorithms to solve the classic problem of Line Intersection. The brute force method of solving this task runs at O(n^2), which is hardly ideal. By utilizing an algorithm that uses Binary Search trees we are able to achieve the task in O(n log n).
