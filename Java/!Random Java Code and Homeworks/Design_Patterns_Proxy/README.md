# Design Patterns : Proxy Design Pattern



This program implements a Proxy Design Pattern by allowing a user to 
log ther username, SSN, and account numbers to a file, but the proxy
does not allow the potentially harmful method that reads them to be 
accessed. To use this program, it prompts you to input your information,
and it saves this information to a .txt file in your username so that 
it could be accessed by the appropriate people. The method used 
to read this information is protected by the proxy design.
