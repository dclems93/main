To test the different string matching methods, I designed a test where I created an 
array of words that President Donald Trump has been known for using frequently and 
I tested the 3 different methods of string traversal on this array of words.

I came up with a total of 15 words, and I added the total run time of each traversal
to a running number for each mothod, naive, KMP, and Boyer. 

I reported the methods by printing the total as well as the average run time.

The winner by far is the Boyer method. This is not surprising as this method
allows the strings to skip many comparrisons, and generating the delta1 array
is not very costly.

Surprisingly, the naive method was the second lowest, with KMP coming in last. 
I suspect this may be because our total string length is a short string, rather 
than a longer text, such as an ebook or such. Because the KMP method requires building a KMP 
array to reference, I hypothesize that this search method would produce much better running
results when compared to a string that is much larger. The time it takes to generate
the flink array would possibly make up for that time on a larger text.

Overall this was one of the more interesting tests to complete of all the projects we have done.
