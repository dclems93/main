# CS343 : String Search

This project utilizes the the Twitter4J Java API to search through a specified backlog of tweets by a given example in order to return stats about that individual's tweets. As an example we used Donald Trump's tweets and returned the frequency of certain words that he is known for using.

The algorithms being used are brute force, KMP, and Boyer. This program will return statistics about how each algorithm performed when searching through many different tweets.
