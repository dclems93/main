# CS343 : Compression

This project takes a .txt file and compresses the text that is contained within the file using Huffman Trees. By generating a Huffman Tree based on the frequency of the use of letters in the English Language, we are able to generate a "key" in order to decipher the compressed text. After the text is compressed we can "decompress" it using the key that we generated.
