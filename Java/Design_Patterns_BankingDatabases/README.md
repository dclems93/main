# Design Patterns: Banking Database

This program implements several design patterns including factory design, singleton, and more in order to create a simple and secure system for multiple banks to create accounts on one system. The program connects to a database and allows users to create a bank account with one or more banks, and then allows users to "add" money to the account. Each bank has their own rules as to what the minimum deposit is to start an account, and some banks have different rules associated with the account. Users can login and check the status of their accounts using a username and password, and can also "withdraw" or "deposit" money into the accounts, but are not allowed to withdraw more money than they currently have in the account. User's can only withdraw money from account's that they own.
